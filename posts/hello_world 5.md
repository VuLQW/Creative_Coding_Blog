# 5th blog

The inspiration came from the art [css3d Sprites](https://threejs.org/examples/#css3d_sprites). The circles moved aroun along with the mouse which made me try to do the same with my own art. Hwever, the main element that caught my attention the most was how ech individual ball created a bigger whole image. As a result I wanted to create something similar. In this case, I created my art in the way that it would create waves.
