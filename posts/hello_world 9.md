# 9th blog


After seeing the previous reddit feed on blog 8, I wanted to see the bigger picture around gaming and feeling burnt out. This [reddit feed](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/imz6r8/gaming_burnout/) focusses more on the feeling of burning out which is a bit different to the water break reddit post on blog 8. Since I wanted to appeal to my community and their drinking habits, I wanted to see what other suggestions people had about the feeling of burning out and what they recommend to do.
