Sparked with the idea of using water as a way to keep gamers hydrated, I came across this [reddit feed](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/kxcunc/raising_awareness_of_staying_hydrated_while_gaming/) created by pathofexile who talks about the importance of drinking water. Many people replied to his feed, expanding on the suggestions, offering more suggestions and joking around as well.
