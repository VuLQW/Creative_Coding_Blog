# 6th blog
<img src="images/square.PNG"></img> 

The inspiration came from the art [Levy Flight](https://qianqian-ye.com/Everyday/Day13/) by Qianqian Ye as well. The randomness and the trail the squares left was nice and fun to use. I liked the way the squares were together creating a chaotic environment which I wanted to also add to my own art. However, I stumbled across the issue where making the squares too big would make the art confusing rather than interesting. I decided to decrease the size of my squares as well as rounding it to keep things polished.
