# 4th blog
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">

I was inspired by this image here which is the Architectual Design Hub of RMIT. I was in the process of creating my net art in which I came across this image and decided to change the colour scheme as well as the shape to create a similar vibe that the building had. The circles were close to eachother whcih worked well with the squares on my art which were also close to eachother as well.
